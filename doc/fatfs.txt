The FAT file system
===================

The FAT file system implementation in remix uses Elm Chan's excellent FatFS package,
available here. It can handle FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32 file systems in read/write mode
and it packs a lot of functionality in a low footprint. Like the ROM filesystem it
is integrated with the C library, so similar POSIX file manipulation will work in
addition to accessing the filesystem via PicocC. remix adds a platform abstraction
layer on top of FatFS which makes it very easy to port the FAT file system
implementation between different remix targets. Since most SD/MMC cards can be
accessed using the very common SPI interface, and since remix already provides an SPI
platform interface, porting the FAT file system to a remix board is a fairly simple
process.

To use the FAT file system on your remix board (that has the proper hardware to access
SD/MMC cards), first make sure that there is a working implementation of the remix SPI
platform interface on your platform (as currently remix can access SD/MMC cards only
via SPI). Then you need to enable the FAT file system module (MMCFS) in your remix
binary image, as described on the building page.

Using the FAT file system
=========================

To use the FAT filesystem with an SD or MMC card, first ensure that the card has been
properly formatted as a FAT filesystem (many come preformatted with this file system).

Next, ensure that you have connected the SD or MMC card using the pin configuration
described in the table below. For more more information, see Elm Chan's page on SD/MMC
with SPI.

remix PIN 	Static Config 	SD Card Pin 	MMC Card Pin
========        =============   ===========     ============    
CS 	        MMCFS_CS_PORT,  DAT3/CS	        RES/CS
                MMCFS_CS_PIN

SPI DO 	        MMCFS_SPI_NUM 	CMD/DI 	        CMD/DI

SPI DI 	        MMCFS_SPI_NUM 	DAT0/DO 	DAT0/DO

SPI SCLK 	MMCFS_SPI_NUM 	CLK 	        CLK

Once configured, connected, and remix has started up, you are ready to work with the
files on your card. To open a file on the SD/MMC card, all you need to do is to prefi
its name with /mmc/, like this:

remix# picoc /mmc/hello.c

Similarly, if you wanted to access a text file a.txt from your card, you could use
fopen like this:

picoc> FILE *fp = fopen("/mmc/a.txt", "rb");
