What is linenoise?
==================

Technically speaking, https://github.com/antirez/linenoise is a small replacement library
for GNU's http://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html (readline) library, which is
already supported by standard PicoC. What it actually does is give you a nice way to edit
your PicoC commands inside the PicoC interpreter (by using the arrow keys and different
other key sequences presented below), recall a line that was already entered, and save the
history of the lines you entered. It's very convenient when prototyping within the PicoC
interpreter, because all the lines entered at the prompt can be saved and turned into a
proper application by editing the save file. It also takes the interpreter much closer to
its desktop counterpart with regards to ease of use.

Linenoise in remix
==================

Starting with version 0.1 remix contains a port of the linenoise library. To use it make
sure it is included in the build. (refer to the build instructions in doc/ for details).
Note that linenoise requires ANSI terminal support (*BUILD_TERM*), so you need to enable
that too. To use it, simply start the PicoC interpreter. The table below contains a list
of keys that can be used to take advantage of linenoise:

|==============================================================================|
| Key(s)                      | Action                                         |
|==============================================================================|
| Left and right              | Move left and right in the current prompt line |
| Up                          | Recall the previous line                       | 
| Down                        | Recall the next line                           |
| CTRL+C                      | Abandon the current line                       |
| Home                        | Go to the beginning of the line                |
| End                         | Go to the end of the line                      |
| CTRL+K                      | Delete from the cursor to the end of the line  |
| CTRL+U                      | Delete the current line			       | 
|==============================================================================|

To save the history, simply call *picoc_save_history()* with the name of the file in which the
history will be saved. Be careful, the file will be overwritten. The exact same keys presented
in the table above can be used by the remix shell if linenoise is enabled for it. However, you
won't be able to save history from the remix shell. The reason why this component isn't enabled
by default is that it takes RAM (like all good things in remix :) ) so keep this in mind when
deciding if you want it or not.

IMPORTANT: linenoise support seems to be dependent on the terminal emulator used with remix
on the PC side. It _hasn't_ been tested extensively with remix. Basically, it is supposed to
work with eLua on TeraTerm (http://www.ayera.com/teraterm/) under Windows and with _screen_
in GNU/Linux. Other terminal emulators might not work equally well.
