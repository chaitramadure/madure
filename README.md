Remix Embedded
==============

Remix - a remix of wise microcontroller thoughts

Remix strives to be a free and open source software system for 32-bit microcontrollers. It provides a convenient method to do interactive embedded development in PicoC, a light weight C language interpreter. PicoC offers a rich subset of regular ANSI C language functions. Remix is available under the MIT free software license.

Features:

- Full control of the platform: There is no requisite for an Operating System between your programs and the microcontroller
- Source code portability: Any program being interpretted can also be easily compiled
- Shell environment for user interaction 
- Optimized for memory consumption (look into tiny RAM patch)
- FAT file system (e.g. for the SD/MMC card interface)
- XMODEM protocol for convenient sharing of files with PC
